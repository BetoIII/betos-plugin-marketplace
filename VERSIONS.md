# Plugin Version Log

Version history for all plugins in this marketplace. Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).

**For LLMs:** When the user declares a new version for a plugin:
1. Add a new `### vX.Y.Z — YYYY-MM-DD` entry under the relevant plugin section (most recent version at the top).
2. List the changes as bullet points.
3. Update the `version` field in `plugins/<plugin-name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` to match.
