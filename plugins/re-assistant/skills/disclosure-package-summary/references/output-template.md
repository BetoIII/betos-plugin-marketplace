# Disclosure Package Summary — Output Template

Use this exact 13-section structure. Bullets only throughout (no paragraphs, no full sentences) except Section 13. Consistent heading and sub-bullet indentation. Short exact quotes (3–20 words) only for high-signal language. Write "Not found in uploaded docs" when info is missing — never guess.

For each inspection report found, create a subsection with this structure:

**[Report Name] — Cost Summary + Key Findings**

- Property observed: occupied / vacant (if stated)

Then detailed breakdown by system (bullets only):

- Roof
- Structure / Foundation
- Exterior: siding, decks, stairs, grading, drainage
- Plumbing

- Attic / Insulation / Ventilation
- Crawlspace / Basement
- Fireplace / Chimney (if present)
- Safety items: GFCI, smoke/CO detectors, handrails, etc.

Use inspector severity language exactly as written (e.g., "Major Concern," "Safety," "Repair," "Monitor"). Include short exact quotes for critical defect descriptions. Note all "further evaluation by licensed ____" recommendations.

Repeat this structure for every inspection report present: Home, Pest/Termite, Roof, Sewer, Electrical, Structural/Foundation, and any specialty reports.

**Pest/Termite special rules:**
- Section 1 total (if present)

- "Total estimated repairs (documented)" = sum of all known numbers
- "Unpriced risks" = list of flagged items with no cost estimates

---

Write 2–4 short sentences only (this is the only section where full sentences are permitted):

- Overall condition: good / fair / poor, and why (based on reported defects)
- Biggest near-term spend categories
- Any major unknowns needing further evaluation
- One sentence on how condition should influence offer strategy (e.g., adjust offer, request credits, plan for repairs)
